# Guido Blee - SailGP Data Analyst Submission

## Overview
I've really enjoyed putting this together, I hope you enjoy seeing what I've done! My 'at least three' answers are:  
- Q1,
- Q2,
- Q5 and,
- Q8.

After doing some research for Q7, I have written some code but it's in a very unfinished state. In the instructions it encourages you to leave anything you've done, even if you didn't answer - otherwise I would have deleted it. 

I also wrote a small module 'helpers' which contains a few different bits of code I reused across the notebook, I thought it would be easier to read if I wrote them separately and imported.

I look forward to hearing back from you.
